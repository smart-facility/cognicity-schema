### About
CogniCity-schema is the PostgreSQL/PostGIS database schema for the CogniCity Framework.  The schema contains the tables required for data input by [cognicity-reports](https://github.com/smart-facility/cognicity-reports-powertrack), [cognicity-reports-detik](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-reports-detik), [cognicity-reports-lambda](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-reports-lambda), [cognicity-reports-telegram](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-reports-telegram) and data output using [cognicity-server](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-server).

For a comprehensive overview of CogniCity v1.0, including the original database schema see Chapter 2 of:
> "White Paper - PetaJakarta.org:
Assessing the Role of Social Media for Civic Coâ€‘Management During Monsoon Flooding
in Jakarta, Indonesia", 2014. Holderness T & Turpin E. [ISBN 978-1-74128-249-8 ](http://petajakarta.org/banjir/en/research/)

#### Reports
Input data sources for reporting are received into separate schemas, named by report types. Trigger functions in each data source's schema normalise the different report data and push it to the global cognicity.all_reports table (see Table below).

#### Risk Evaluation Matrix (REM)
Flood affected area polygon data provided by emergency services via the REM interface is stored in the cognicity.rem_status table. The geographic data for these areas is stored in the cognicity.local_areas table.

### Dependencies
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) version 9.6 or later, with
* [PostGIS](http://postgis.net) version 2.3 or later

### Installation
* The PostgreSQL database server must be running with a UTF-8 character set.

#### Installing the schema and data
This build `build/run.sh` script looks for the following environment variables:
- $PGHOST
- $PGUSER
- $PGDATABASE
- $COUNTRY (country for instance)
- $DATA (true | false - whether to load data)
- $FUNCTIONS (true | false - whether to load schema functions)
- $SCHEMA (true | false - whether to load schema definitions)

Country names should match the name specified in the `/data/` folder.

To install the database and load data for specified country run:
```sh
$ export COUNTRY=indonesia
$ build/run.sh
```
This will create a database, build the empty schema and insert available data.


#### Use of RDS image
A blank database of the schema is also available as an [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) PostgreSQL snapshot in the ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) region, ARN: arn:aws:rds:ap-southeast-1:917524458155:snapshot:cognicity-v3
To use:
* First copy the snapshot to the region (if not ap-southeast-1) where you want to start your instance.
* In the RDS snapshots page for the region where you you want to start your instance, select the copied snapshot and restore it.
* Modify the database, I recommend:
  - creating a new parameter group (from the postgres 9.6 original) that sets rds.force_ssl to 1.
  - setting a password (for user postgres).
  - for production environments, using a multi-AZ setup for redundancy and setting the size to 100 GB for better IOPS performance.

### Testing
Tests are run using NodeJS with Unit.js and Mocha to insert dummy values and perform integration testing on the database against the sample data sources.
To run tests:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm test
```


#### Adding New City
Instructions to add a new city in cognicity-schema
* Install the database and load data for specified country run:
```sh
$ export COUNTRY=indonesia
$ build/run.sh
```
This will create a database, build the empty schema and insert available data into postgres.

* prepare instance_region and local_area data for the city with same columns as schema.

* Add the cleaned up data into schema
```sh
$ shp2pgsql -I -d -s 4326 <FILENAME.SHP> <SCHEMA>.<TABLE> | psql -U postgres -d <DATABASE>
```
* select table>backup and add data into data.sql file in cognicity-schema repo

* add new instance in tests at index.js - change pkey, instance_region_code, report location and test.


### Contribution Guidelines
* Issues are tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-schema/issues)

### Release
The release procedure is as follows:
- Update the CHANGELOG.md file with the newly released version and high-level overview of changes.
- Check that package.json contains the correct release version number.
- Check that package-lock.json contains the correct release version number.
- Check that schema/cognicity/cognicity.schema.functions.sql `cognicity.version()` function returns the correct release version number.
- Commit any changes and tag in git from the current head of master. The tag should be the same as the version specified in the package.json file and elsewhere - this is the release version.
- Pull changes into dev branch.
- Increment the version number in package.json, package-lock.json, and `cognicity.version()`.
- Commit these changes with the message 'Opened new version for development'.
- Further development is now on the updated version number until the release process begins  again.
